## 8.1 Time synchronization

As many glider users are familiar with, it is essential to sync the time between the glider and their sensors. With the HydroC CO<sub>2</sub> this is carried out when the sensor is turned on with a clock-sync with gps. The internal clock in the HydroC is stable, so this only needs to happen at the beginning of the mission or in the lab before deployment.

## 8.2 Geometrical alignment

Since the HydroC CO<sub>2</sub> is integrated into the nosecone of the seaglider, forward of the standard CTD location near the aft hatch, geometric alignment is necessary to determine the exact location where a *p*CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was recorded. Because the *p*CO<sub>2</sub> signal needs to be corrected for response time, it is easier to find the pressure at the location of the *p*CO<sub>2</sub> measurement (e.g. see [Woo, 2023](https://dx.doi.org/10.26198/5c997b5fdc9bd)) rather than finding the time offset and further convoluting the response time correction.This can be accomplished using geometry.

```math
P_{Hydroc} = P_{CTD} - sin(Œ∏)*d p_ctd 
```



Where P<sub>HydroC</sub> is the pressure associated with the *p*CO<sub>2</sub> measurement, P<sub>CTD</sub> is the pressure associated with the glider CTD measurement, Œ∏ is the glider pitch, and d is the distance between the sensors.

## 8.3 Sensor response time correction

For equilibrium-based (EB) sensors, the sensor response time (RT) is directly governed by how fast the analyte can diffuse through the membrane. The ability to determine the in situ response time (œÑ<sub>63</sub> of the HydroC, which took into account membrane characteristics and the rate of water exchange over the membrane, i.e. pump characteristics) of the sensor makes correction for hysteresis through data post processing possible (Figure 8.1). Although the RTC method of Miloshevich et al. (2004) has been previously used for HydroC CO2 correction from a profiling float (Fielder et al. 2013) and is very simple to implement, the D√∏lven et al. (2022) RTC method produced more realistic profiles. Additionally, D√∏lven et al. (2022) developed their algorithm with equilibrium-based sensors in mind and was proven with a sensor with a long response time (HydroC CH4 ùùâ63 ‚âÖ 23 minutes) and provides an explicit uncertainty estimate of the response-time-corrected signal.

The [D√∏lven et al. (2022)](https://gi.copernicus.org/articles/11/293/2022/) RTC solution is based on the framework of statistical inverse problems and linear regression and assumes the relationship between observed quantity, ua(t), and measured quantity, um(t) is governed by the growth-law equation (eq 1 Dolven et al 2022). Uses weighted linear least-squares estimator, the growth-law equation as measurement model, and a sparsity regularized solution.

Response time for the HydroC CO2T sensors are determined during calibration at -4H-JENA and are necessary for response time correction (RTC). Field verification of the response time is recommended to ensure the highest quality post-processed data product because œÑ<sub>63</sub> can be affected by the speed of water exchange across the membrane (e.g. pump speed, tube length, etc.), see Section 4.1.1.2.

Before RTC is applied, HydroC CO<sub>2</sub> data may need to be smoothed to avoid/limit erroneous spikes in the RTC signal. For our project, smoothing was applied using a quadratic regression (MATLAB‚Äôs smoothdata.m function with the loess method) over a 2-minute window to maintain the original 2 second resolution of the *p*CO<sub>2</sub> data.
