# Carbon Dioxide SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/britairving/Carbon_Dioxide_SOP) provides a *draft* standard operating procedure (SOP) document for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) with the aim of providing documentation to future users of some of the steps necessary to collect good quality partial pressure of carbon dioxide (*p*CO<sub>2</sub>) data with a CONTROS HydroCTM CO2T sensor installed on a M1 Seaglider for both real time and post deployment data streams. It is the hope of the authors that this SOP will be expanded in the future to include other *p*CO<sub>2</sub> sensors and ocean gliders. This SOP has been modeled after the [Ocean Gliders community SOP](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity) format with that hope in mind. 

Please see [Hauri et al., 2024](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-1055/) for more on this project.
