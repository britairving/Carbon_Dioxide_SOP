# Data sharing

The authors of this SOP strive to meet the highest standards of data transparency and reproducibility - in line with OceanGliders who strongly encourages all glider operators to share their data to the public and provide open access both in real time and delayed mode. The best practices of data sharing are described in the [OceanGliders data management user manual](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual).
