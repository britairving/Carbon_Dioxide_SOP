# Post-recovery operations and calibrations

Immediately following recovery, rinse the HydroC with freshwater and then let HydroC run in air for 1 hour to dry membrane and internal gas circuitry.

Return the HydroC to the manufacturer for a post-deployment calibration to allow span drift (changes in the sensor’s concentration dependent characteristics) correction during post processing using pre- and post-calibration coefficients interpolated over the deployment {cite}`Fietzeketal2014`.
