abstract = {Pairs of marine carbonate system variables are often used to calculate others, but those results are seldom reported with estimates of uncertainties. Although the procedure to propagate these uncertainties is well known, it has not been offered in public packages that compute marine carbonate chemistry, fundamental tools that are relied on by the community. To remedy this shortcoming, four of these packages were expanded to calculate sensitivities of computed variables with respect to each input variable and to use those sensitivities along with user-specified estimates of input uncertainties (standard uncertainties) to propagate uncertainties of calculated variables (combined standard uncertainties). Sensitivities from these packages agree with one another and with analytical solutions to within 0.01%; similar agreement among packages was found for the combined standard uncertainties. One package was used to quantify how propagated uncertainties vary among computed variables, seawater conditions, and the chosen pair of carbonate system variables that is used as input. The relative contributions to propagated uncertainties from the standard uncertainties of the input pair of measurements and various other input data (equilibrium constants etc) were explored with a new type of diagram. These error-space diagrams illustrate that further improvement beyond today's state-of-the-art measurement uncertainties for the input pair would generally be ineffective at reducing the combined standard uncertainties because the contribution from the constants is larger. Likewise, using much more uncertain measurements of the input pair does not always substantially worsen combined standard uncertainty. The constants that contribute most to combined standard uncertainties are generally K1 and K2, as expected. Yet more of the propagated uncertainty in the computed saturation states of aragonite and calcite comes from their solubility products. Thus percent relative combined standard uncertainties for the saturation states are larger than for the carbonate ion concentration. Routine propagation of these uncertainties should become standard practice.}

abstract = {Teflon AF 2400 (Du Pont) is an amorphous, glassy perfluorinated copolymer containing 87 mol% 2,2-bistrifluoromethyl-4,5-difluoro-1,3-dioxole and 13 mol% tetrafluoroethylene. The polymer has an extremely high fractional free volume of 0.327. Permeability coefficients for helium, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, and chlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22) were determined at temperatures from 25 to 60°C and pressures from 20 to 120 psig. Permeation properties were also determined at a feed pressure of 200 psig at 25°C with a 2 mol% n-butane/98 mol% methane mixture. Permeabilities of permanent gases in Teflon AF 2400 are among the highest of all known polymers; the oxygen permeability coefficient at 25°C is 1600 × 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg and the nitrogen permeability coefficient is 780 × 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg. The permeabilities of organic vapors increase up to 20-fold as the vapor activity increases from 0.1 to unity, indicating that Teflon AF 2400 is easily plasticized. Although Teflon AF 2400 is an ultrahigh-free-volume polymer like poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) [PTMSP], their gas permeation properties differ significantly. Teflon AF 2400 shows gas transport behavior similar to that of conventional, low-free-volume glassy polymers. PTMSP, on the other hand, acts more like a nanoporous carbon than a conventional glassy polymer.}
