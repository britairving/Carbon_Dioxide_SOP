# Acknowledgement

We would like to thank the National Oceanographic Partnership Program and the National Science Foundation for the support of this project (OCE-1841948).

The Seaglider field trials took place in the traditional and contemporary hunting grounds of the Sugpiaq People. We also acknowledge that our Fairbanks-based offices are located on the Native lands of the Lower Tanana Dena. The Indigenous Peoples never surrendered lands or resources to Russia or the United States. We acknowledge this not only because we are grateful to the Indigenous communities who have been in deep connection with the land and water for time immemorial, but also in recognition of the historical and ongoing legacy of colonialism. We are committed to improving our scientific approaches and working towards co-production for a better future for everyone.

We would like to thank Jack Triest for his technical support throughout the project. We are also grateful to Brian Mullaly, Captain of the RV Nanuq, and Seward Marine Center staff, especially Pete Shipton, Ed DeCastro, Jenny Grischuk, and Jenny Elhard for their assistance during the field trials in Seward. We are also grateful for the support from the Alutiiq Pride Marine Institute, Alaska Sealife Center, and the Autonomous Remote Technology Lab. We would also like to thank the support of JÃ¶ran Kemme at 4-H JENA and Cyprus Subsea engineers Sergey Vekli, Loizos Groutas, and Jerald Reodica in mechanical and electronic sensor integration and piloting, as well as assisting with Cyprus sea testing of the HydroC sensors and CO<sub>2</sub> Seaglider.
