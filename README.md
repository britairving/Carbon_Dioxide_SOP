# Carbon Dioxide SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/britairving/Carbon_Dioxide_SOP) provides a draft standard operating procedure (SOP) document for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) with the aim of providing documentation to future users of some of the steps necessary to collect good quality partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) data with a CONTROS HydroCTM CO2T sensor installed on a M1 Seaglider for both real time and post deployment data streams. It is the hope of the authors that this SOP will be expanded in the future to include other pCO2 sensors and ocean gliders. This SOP has been modeled after the [Ocean Gliders community SOP](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity) format with that hope in mind.
